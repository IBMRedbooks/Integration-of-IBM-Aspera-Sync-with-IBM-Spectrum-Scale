The following mmapply policy command assumes that:
- the file system is /ibm/userfs
- the node where ascp runs on is g8_node1
- one ascp process is launched (-m 1)
- this ascp process processes 1000 files at a time (-B 1000)
- the last run of the ascp command was on the date specified with LAST_XFER
- the fileset name is "testaspera"

# mmapplypolicy /ibm/userfs -P async_policy -N g8_node1 --single-instance -m 1 -M LAST_XFER=`date -d "2018-05-30 13:30:00" +%s` -M FSETNAME=testaspera
